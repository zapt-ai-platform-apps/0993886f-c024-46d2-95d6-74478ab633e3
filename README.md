# Colour Art Analyzer

Colour Art Analyzer is a web application that analyzes a photograph to extract its dominant colours and creates a unique piece of artwork based on the colour palette. Users can choose how the final artwork is rendered, including options for remixing the colours, applying a pixel effect, and even changing the overall shape of the image. Additionally, users can download a detailed colour swatch file containing the HEX codes and percentages for each colour used in the artwork.
