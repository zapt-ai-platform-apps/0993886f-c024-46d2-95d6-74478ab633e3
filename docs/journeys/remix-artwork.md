# Remix Artwork

This journey explains how to use the remix feature to change the layout of the artwork.

1. **Toggle Remix Mode**
   - After analyzing the image, click on the "Remix" button.
   - Remix mode rearranges the artwork into equal-sized blocks, with one block per extracted colour.
   - If you click the button again, the artwork reverts to the original proportional layout.

2. **Visual Feedback**
   - The artwork dynamically updates to display the new block layout.
   - The remix mode ensures that the number of blocks exactly matches the number of colours selected.

3. **Experiment with Other Settings**
   - You can combine remix mode with different shape selections (Rectangle, Square, or Circle) and pixel effects.
   - Adjust the settings and re-run the analysis to see different outcomes.
